We review recent theoretical progress in describing collective effects in photon+nucleus collisions. The approaches considered range from the color glass condensate where correlations are encoded in the initial state, to hydrodynamic frameworks, where a strong final state response to the initial geometry of the collision is the key ingredient to generate momentum-space correlations.
