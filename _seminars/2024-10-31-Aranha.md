The early part of the gravitational wave signal of binary neutron-star inspirals can potentially yield robust information on the nuclear equation of state. The influence of a star's internal structure on the waveform is characterized by a single parameter: the tidal deformability 𝜆, which measures the star's quadrupole deformation in response to the companion's perturbing tidal field. We calculate 𝜆 for a wide range of equations of state and find that the value of 𝜆 spans an order of magnitude for the range of equation of state models considered. An analysis of the feasibility of discriminating between neutron-star equations of state with gravitational wave observations of the early part of the inspiral reveals that the measurement error in 𝜆 increases steeply with the total mass of the binary. Comparing the errors with the expected range of 𝜆, we find that Advanced LIGO observations of binaries at a distance of 100 Mpc will probe only unusually stiff equations of state, while the proposed Einstein Telescope is likely to see a clean tidal signature.
